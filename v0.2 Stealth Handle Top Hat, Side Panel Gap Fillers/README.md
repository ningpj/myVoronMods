# v0.2r1 Stealth Handle Top Hat, Side Panel Gap Fillers

## Description

I use the awesome Stealth Handles on my v0.2r1 created by Discord user Andre#7463 (https://www.printables.com/model/481575-v0-stealth-handles) and needed a secure, snap-in option to fill-in the top hat side gaps to minimise heat loss.
Another discord user knocked up something similar for Misumi 1515 extrusions but were unfortunately easily dislodged and didn’t clip in securely for my Formbot extrusions.  This version is a very tight fit and has a full length press fit clip to secure it in the 1515 channel.
Best to ease them in at a slight angle from one end before pressing them in fully to avoid breaking the press fit profile (I really didn’t want them to rattle, cause resonance or fall out!).   

Left and right options provided for v0.2r1 standard panel clips.
